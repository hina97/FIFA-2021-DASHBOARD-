# ⚽ FIFA 2021 Data Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains a complete analysis of the **FIFA 2021 Player Dataset**, including data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation using **Power BI** (and optionally Excel).  
The project aims to help users explore player attributes, club performance, wage/value insights, and overall football analytics in an interactive way.
 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Done in Excel)

The dataset was fully cleaned using **Microsoft Excel**, including:

- Removed special characters from **Value**, **Wage**, and **Release Clause**.
- Converted currency formats (€, K, M) into proper numeric values using Excel formulas.
- Cleaned player names by removing non-English or special characters.
- Standardized **Height** and **Weight** fields.
- Fixed inconsistent formats (dates, text cases, spacing).
- Removed duplicates and blank rows.
- Applied Excel's **Text to Columns**, **Find & Replace**, and **Data Cleaning Functions**.
- Ensured UTF-8 compatibility before loading into Power BI.
